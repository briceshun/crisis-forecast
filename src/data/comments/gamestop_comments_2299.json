I'd say it's out rightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position, The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. I got this tips first hand from Mr. James, he is always a step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money even with the current market crash. My earnings has increased drastically from 2.1Bitcoin to 6.7Bitcoin in just 8 weeks of trading. I've got full confidence in his trading skills and management.\r\nhe can be reached on Telegram @Cryptowithjames", "authorDisplayName": "Valentina Tacchini", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqZn94-m5Og3Q6ehNGaosqQ"}, "likeCount": 3, "publishedAt": "2021-05-25T11:51:18Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-25T11:51:18Z"}}}}, {"id": "Ugy2_uC_GpLY5VVDASh4AaABAg", "snippet": {"topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"videoId": "XRKyyqjjC6A", "textDisplay": "Just realized all the video you make are related to amc . . .

Credit to reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HCMF_MaceFace/The\">https://www.reddit.com/user/HCMF_MaceFace/The</a> Mother of All Short Squeezes (MOASS) \u2013 Explanation\r<br>Now that we have gone through the many important terms, we can get to the theory behind MOASS.\r<br>\r<br>Due excessive short-selling and naked shorting of GME by certain market participants (primarily large hedge funds and market makers), retail investors and long institutional investors collectively own a number of shares that exceeds the the float. The amount of shares that are currently owned is theorized to range roughly between 200%-400% of the float if not more, meaning that 100%-300% of the float has a corresponding short position (mostly naked shorts). For context, most stocks generally have around 1% Short Interest, and 10%-20% short interest is considered to be excessive, let alone over 100% of it.\r<br>\r<br><br>Short sellers must eventually close, or cover their short position, and the only way to do that is to buy the shares owned by the investors who are long (in the meantime Short-sellers are paying interest on that short position until it is closed proportional to the cost of the shares, which bleeds their capital over time). Unfortunately for the short sellers, the owners of the shares ARE NOT obligated to sell their shares. The short-sellers, however, ARE obligated to buy in order to close their position (or else keep paying interest).\r<br>\r<br><br>So what happens if no one is selling the shares they are \u201clong\u201d on, but short sellers need to buy them? The answer is \u201csupply and demand\u201d. With very little supply and high demand, the price of a stock can increase far beyond its fundamental value\r<br>.

Credit to reddit https://www.reddit.com/user/HCMF_MaceFace/The Mother of All Short Squeezes (MOASS) \u2013 Explanation\r\nNow that we have gone through the many important terms, we can get to the theory behind MOASS.\r\n\r\nDue excessive short-selling and naked shorting of GME by certain market participants (primarily large hedge funds and market makers), retail investors and long institutional investors collectively own a number of shares that exceeds the the float. The amount of shares that are currently owned is theorized to range roughly between 200%-400% of the float if not more, meaning that 100%-300% of the float has a corresponding short position (mostly naked shorts). For context, most stocks generally have around 1% Short Interest, and 10%-20% short interest is considered to be excessive, let alone over 100% of it.\r\n\r\n\nShort sellers must eventually close, or cover their short position, and the only way to do that is to buy the shares owned by the investors who are long (in the meantime Short-sellers are paying interest on that short position until it is closed proportional to the cost of the shares, which bleeds their capital over time). Unfortunately for the short sellers, the owners of the shares ARE NOT obligated to sell their shares. The short-sellers, however, ARE obligated to buy in order to close their position (or else keep paying interest).\r\n\r\n\nSo what happens if no one is selling the shares they are \u201clong\u201d on, but short sellers need to buy them? The answer is \u201csupply and demand\u201d. With very little supply and high demand, the price of a stock can increase far beyond its fundamental value\r\n.

I love the way that we have advocates for tradn and hodlin alone as well as most befuddle purchasing and holding coins as a venture. That is dangerous on the grounds that most analysis about future expectations aren&#39;t right. No one knows without a doubt the future with btc or the ALTs and talking about capitulation and an inversion where the bulls assume responsibility totally, you must be certain when it previously occurred. 3 years prior, we thought it was a capitulation when BTC dropped from about 20k to 4k and it was relied upon to rapidly bounce back and find new highs. You need to get an excellent framework for you to be effective in the crypto market. Anything can occur on the lookout. A note of caution to beginners and mid_experience dealers is to be cautious in the event that you don&#39;t totally comprehend or understand what you are doing on the grounds that simply like how crypto is building individuals on their approach to riches, it is likewise obliterating and bankrupting others so don&#39;t follow the FUD or FOMO yet follow the cash. I was guided constantly by Gary Saville exchange examples and signs. That by itself caused me even a trader. He is an incredible investigator and amazingly great at planning exchange procedures for various market circumstances and his signs are exact. I&#39;ll advice you to trade your BTC you have with precise trad signs and methodology.

I love the way that we have advocates for tradn and hodlin alone as well as most befuddle purchasing and holding coins as a venture. That is dangerous on the grounds that most analysis about future expectations aren't right. No one knows without a doubt the future with btc or the ALTs and talking about capitulation and an inversion where the bulls assume responsibility totally, you must be certain when it previously occurred. 3 years prior, we thought it was a capitulation when BTC dropped from about 20k to 4k and it was relied upon to rapidly bounce back and find new highs. You need to get an excellent framework for you to be effective in the crypto market. Anything can occur on the lookout. A note of caution to beginners and mid_experience dealers is to be cautious in the event that you don't totally comprehend or understand what you are doing on the grounds that simply like how crypto is building individuals on their approach to riches, it is likewise obliterating and bankrupting others so don't follow the FUD or FOMO yet follow the cash. I was guided constantly by Gary Saville exchange examples and signs. That by itself caused me even a trader.
