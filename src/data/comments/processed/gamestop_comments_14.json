Yet, with Wanda, who sold millions of shares, they rationalize.  Seriously.  You guys deserve to be duped for not having an outcry against Wanda.  They sold us off three times.  First in January, then in March, and now in May, when we had the perfect storm again!! And people are not angry!?!?!? Wanda is on the board of AMC.\r<br>\r<br>When I heard those news, I immediately sold.  My average was $6.34.  Yeah, go ahead, call me paper hands, shills, fuds, w/e.  But your hypocrisy is astonishing, when one can&#39;t say anything about Wanda, yet you try to reprehend other apes for taking a profit.\r<br>\r<br>The apes have two weaknesses.  They&#39;re not open to criticism and they rationalize.  I hope that the ones that are in red numbers make it out with green numbers.  I really hope that you win something.  But if you keep holding and others are making profits, then don&#39;t be angry a few months from now.  You have to see that while you&#39;re holding and holding, many are selling at your expense.  Many, the day traders, are coming in to ride the train and leave when the price is $14-16 dollars, making good profits.  Sorry apes, but, again, if you&#39;re not making profits for not being more clever, then this is entirely your fault.\r<br>\r<br>And if you&#39;re quoting that reddit theory, key word being &quot;theory&quot;, about AMC gathering info with SEC to sue the shorters for manipulating the price. My goodness, why are you rationalizing these things? Wake up!!!\r<br>\r<br>By August, we&#39;re going to see what Vanguard and Blackrock did with their shares.  For one, I think that Blackrock has been lending them to Citadel, as they were known to help the short against Tesla in 2018.  But then again, both, Vanguard and Blackrock probably sold their shares.\r<br>\r<br>Now, if you have 3 super big whales, Vanguard, Blackrock and Wanda, selling their shares.  This means they didn&#39;t believe in the squeeze.  I sold when I heard about Wanda.  But I also thing other people sold.  Now, if you haven&#39;t sold and you&#39;re still winning, then more power to you.  You do what you want.  But if the floor is truly $100K or $500K, then what does it matter if you have 10 shares or 100, you will still be a millionaire, right?\r<br>\r<br>Those who are in red, don&#39;t worry the price will again rise, as I think the apes will continue to hold.  You are the new apes, the ones in red numbers. The ones that bought at $13-15.  So you will hold, the price will rise again, people will ride the train, then you will leave.  Honestly, I didn&#39;t see it before, because I didn&#39;t know better.\r<br>\r<br>Call me whatever you want.  But if you&#39;re mad at me for selling, then rationalize that I need to feed my family.  Just like you rationalize that Wanda just &quot;had to do it&quot;. Get out of here, hypocrites!!!", "textOriginal": "You just gotta love people hating on other apes for selling, calling them paper hands.  Yet, with Wanda, who sold millions of shares, they rationalize.  Seriously.  You guys deserve to be duped for not having an outcry against Wanda.  They sold us off three times.  First in January, then in March, and now in May, when we had the perfect storm again!! And people are not angry!?!?!? Wanda is on the board of AMC.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard those news, I immediately sold.  My average was $6.34.  Yeah, go ahead, call me paper hands, shills, fuds, w/e.  But your hypocrisy is astonishing, when one can't say anything about Wanda, yet you try to reprehend other apes for taking a profit.\r\n\r\nThe apes have two weaknesses.  They're not open to criticism and they rationalize.  I hope that the ones that are in red numbers make it out with green numbers.  I really hope that you win something.  But if you keep holding and others are making profits, then don't be angry a few months from now.  You have to see that while you're holding and holding, many are selling at your expense.  Many, the day traders, are coming in to ride the train and leave when the price is $14-16 dollars, making good profits.  Sorry apes, but, again, if you're not making profits for not being more clever, then this is entirely your fault.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're quoting that reddit theory, key word being \"theory\", about AMC gathering info with SEC to sue the shorters for manipulating the price. My goodness, why are you rationalizing these things? Wake up!!!\r\n\r\nBy August, we're going to see what Vanguard and Blackrock did with their shares.  For one, I think that Blackrock has been lending them to Citadel, as they were known to help the short against Tesla in 2018.  But then again, both, Vanguard and Blackrock probably sold their shares.\r\n\r\nNow, if you have 3 super big whales, Vanguard, Blackrock and Wanda, selling their shares.  This means they didn't believe in the squeeze.  I sold when I heard about Wanda.  But I also thing other people sold.  Now, if you haven't sold and you're still winning, then more power to you.  You do what you want.  But if the floor is truly $100K or $500K, then what does it matter if you have 10 shares or 100, you will still be a millionaire, right?\r\n\r\nThose who are in red, don't worry the price will again rise, as I think the apes will continue to hold.  You are the new apes, the ones in red numbers. The ones that bought at $13-15.  So you will hold, the price will rise again, people will ride the train, then you will leave.  Honestly, I didn't see it before, because I didn't know better.\r\n\r\nCall me whatever you want.  But if you're mad at me for selling, then rationalize that I need to feed my family.

I have written an email to Gemini support 3 days ago, and I have not heard, or had a response, at all. Is anyone else having this problem with the Gemini Exchange?", "authorDisplayName": "Mike Pelletier", "publishedAt": "2021-05-23T09:25:36Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-23T09:25:36Z"}, {"commentid": "UgxOk2k3ZriVDY7cxyN4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "Go away with the joke coin talk already, y\u2019all so out of touch", "textOriginal": "Go away with the joke coin talk already, y\u2019all so out of touch", "authorDisplayName": "JOHNNY UPLOADZ", "publishedAt": "2021-05-23T05:40:52Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-23T05:40:52Z"}, {"commentid": "UgzqEEFJIlNdBOqk_TB4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "Douche coin ?", "textOriginal": "Douche coin ?", "authorDisplayName": "Thos Bravo", "publishedAt": "2021-05-23T02:19:19Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-23T02:19:19Z"}, {"commentid": "UgwV1y5IV_jv0S7grAR4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "Motley Fool is a financial marketing jinx setting Etheruem up for failure?", "textOriginal": "Motley Fool is a financial marketing jinx setting Etheruem up for failure?", "authorDisplayName": "Omar Parker Sr., MBA", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T21:52:15Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-22T21:54:25Z"}, {"commentid": "UgyDN8toD251GCusIzZ4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "Shibaken seems like the best &amp; cheapest dogecoin with the most potential at the moment, dev team seems really solid", "textOriginal": "Shibaken seems like the best & cheapest dogecoin with the most potential at the moment, dev team seems really solid", "authorDisplayName": "Jimmy B", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T15:59:48Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-22T15:59:48Z"}, {"commentid": "UgxClNWSP4sGtBaDkkZ4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "Doge gonna take over....watch and see....", "textOriginal": "Doge gonna take over....watch and see....", "authorDisplayName": "Radouane", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T12:11:55Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-22T12:11:55Z"}, {"commentid": "UgxwIzvYQN4d_IsfmiB4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "BCTR \u2013 Ready for Takeoff", "textOriginal": "BCTR \u2013 Ready for Takeoff", "authorDisplayName": "Kumar Anand", "publishedAt": "2021-05-22T12:07:09Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-22T12:07:09Z"}, {"commentid": "Ugxano2KFlzgPiorqvd4AaABAg", "videoId": "sWG_huj4Uyg", "textDisplay": "WHATS BETTER THAN SOME ASS??????

Survival was easy, the only time I would die is by messing with the wrong volatile or by falling to my death. Chases were super easy to get out of and super hard to get into. The only zombies I felt like I ever saw were the howlers, runners and biters. The maps design is no where near as good as was shown in the 2018 e3 gameplay. I felt as though there were no objective ever. Even when I found a GRE container and upgraded my skills, It was never satisfying or exciting. The only challenge I found in the game was nests. Those are very scary and if you get caught then your probably gonna die. Especially if it was daytime. The parkour could\u2019ve been so much better with a better map design. That\u2019s my biggest gripe. I\u2019d honestly give this game a 4/10. The only time I enjoyed the game was during my first play through of the story. That\u2019s only because it was my first times playing and it was very exciting then. But I did not enjoy it because of the story. Yeah there were some enjoyable moments but overall it wasn\u2019t that good. I don\u2019t think updates can save the game. I think it\u2019s too far gone.
