SPREAD THE WORD PLEASE Check out that beautiful short interest we\u2019re about to beat GameStop and Volkwagen hold on tight don\u2019t be manipulated by news media\u2019s using everyone as pawns we will win. Keep buying this outstanding float. We will be rewarded heavily for our service. HEDGE FUNDS ARE NAKED SHORTING AND SHORT LADDERING AMC TO KEEP US DOWN BUT ONLY POSTPONES Beautiful SQUEEZE BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER IN BLOCKS TO MAKE UP FOR RECOGNIZED LOSSES.  BUY IN ON THIS GOLD MINE OPPORTUNITY, EVERYDAY WE BUY AND HOLD SHORT SELLERS HAVE ACCRUING MARGINAL INTEREST AND BORROWING FEES. HEDGE FUNDS WILL BE MARGIN CALLED AND LIQUIDATED.

We are using the word investing for trading. New people to investing should not be trading. They need to learn a lot more. Regardless of the push notifications they will lose their money. The system profiting off retail traders has been going on long before Robinhood was even thought of. Most institutions use data to bet against retail traders. Now these platforms just aren&#39;t making the commissions like they used to because Robinhood has forced many to go commission free. Each of these platforms though, still make money of retail traders through many steps. Robinhood just so happens to also be a terrible platform for trading and I agree this is on purpose. There is a reason Robinhood has insanely dumbed down charts. When you have a platform that encourages trading but then doesn&#39;t provide proper tools to do so that should be a red flag. But many of these people trading have no idea what they are looking at or what they should be looking for. They are being played and have no idea. For someone like myself that writes finance programs, I am pretty aware of the parameters that these functions use to determine buy and sell orders. The variables are time and risk but beyond the variables most algos use similar parameters to gauge a buy or sell. If you can&#39;t do that, you need to focus on investing and not trading or at least swings between 3mo-12mo. Then you need to understand moving averages and time frames. This is just the basics and investing can be even more complex but you are still better off as long as you don&#39;t buy stocks like HMNY thinking it is going to be the next big thing because you aren&#39;t aware of how terrible the business model is. You should just invest in established company&#39;s (while you are still learning) or look up common ETFs and see what stocks are in them and try making your own little personal portfolio from that list.  Sure you can get lucky trading but you need to make sure your gains are consistent. I see Meet Kevin commented. I actually stopped watching his videos because he would suggest Robinhood. I can&#39;t take people seriously if they are pushing this sort of application to make trades. Still just another person using entertainment to make money but not thinking about the ethics of what they are promoting. If you know anything about trading you would not suggest the worst platform to do so just because that is what people are searching for. Use your platform to educated and teach people not to use Robinhood and why. Anyways, there are a ton of new traders out there today and it will take them a long ass time to learn and a lot of money regardless of the platform. But for those Youtubers out there putting on a tie and acting like they can help you make money and you can clearly see none of the advice has made you money consistently over the year... you may want to rethink who you are getting your advice from. When they say &quot;this is not financial advice&quot; then they start giving you financial advice.... the only reason they would need to do this if they were making money from said advice. These people are polished, have great cameras, enthusiasm, and production quality out the ass hole, but look at other people actually in the field. Many of their videos have terrible sound/video quality, and are sort of boring but give some of the best advice. Keep going back to the drawing board and take entertainment as entertainment. Entertainers need to understand the ethics behind what they are doing. This is sort of like FOX and CNN claiming they are entertainment news to save themselves from legal ramifications on reporting false narratives when they know very well people look to them for actual news. Hold people accountable for their intentions by supporting people that actually add value to your life so that maybe those people can change and post better material that is actually educational and not just entertaining.", "textOriginal": "The entire argument is off. We are using the word investing for trading. New people to investing should not be trading. They need to learn a lot more. Regardless of the push notifications they will lose their money. The system profiting off retail traders has been going on long before Robinhood was even thought of. Most institutions use data to bet against retail traders. Now these platforms just aren't making the commissions like they used to because Robinhood has forced many to go commission free. Each of these platforms though, still make money of retail traders through many steps. Robinhood just so happens to also be a terrible platform for trading and I agree this is on purpose. There is a reason Robinhood has insanely dumbed down charts. When you have a platform that encourages trading but then doesn't provide proper tools to do so that should be a red flag. But many of these people trading have no idea what they are looking at or what they should be looking for. They are being played and have no idea. For someone like myself that writes finance programs, I am pretty aware of the parameters that these functions use to determine buy and sell orders. The variables are time and risk but beyond the variables most algos use similar parameters to gauge a buy or sell. If you can't do that, you need to focus on investing and not trading or at least swings between 3mo-12mo. Then you need to understand moving averages and time frames. This is just the basics and investing can be even more complex but you are still better off as long as you don't buy stocks like HMNY thinking it is going to be the next big thing because you aren't aware of how terrible the business model is. You should just invest in established company's (while you are still learning) or look up common ETFs and see what stocks are in them and try making your own little personal portfolio from that list.  Sure you can get lucky trading but you need to make sure your gains are consistent. I see Meet Kevin commented. I actually stopped watching his videos because he would suggest Robinhood. I can't take people seriously if they are pushing this sort of application to make trades.
