Apparently some folks over there discovered you during the early days of the initial GME short squeeze, and they&#39;ve been posting links to your channel on the WSB subreddit ever since. I found my way here through one such link, in a post that spoke very highly of you and encouraged others to check out your channel. As one content creator to another, I think your ability to interpret and present the incredibly complex world of the stock market &quot;in plain English&quot; is one of the main reasons for your appeal to a younger audience on this channel, as is your all-around friendly and approachable personality. I for one am 35 years old and have found your discussions to be a fantastically useful resource. Meanwhile, most people I know who are around your age either never put any of their savings into the stock market, or lost everything they&#39;d invested during the multitude of financial crises that have occurred over the past 20 or 30 years. It seems to me that this trend, in addition to how much easier it is to buy and sell stocks online nowadays compared to how tedious it was to call your stockbroker for every transaction back in the day, probably helps explain why so few people of your own generation have followed you here from your travel channel. Either way, you&#39;re doing great work\u2014please keep it up!

Apparently some folks over there discovered you during the early days of the initial GME short squeeze, and they've been posting links to your channel on the WSB subreddit ever since. I found my way here through one such link, in a post that spoke very highly of you and encouraged others to check out your channel. As one content creator to another, I think your ability to interpret and present the incredibly complex world of the stock market \"in plain English\" is one of the main reasons for your appeal to a younger audience on this channel, as is your all-around friendly and approachable personality. I for one am 35 years old and have found your discussions to be a fantastically useful resource. Meanwhile, most people I know who are around your age either never put any of their savings into the stock market, or lost everything they'd invested during the multitude of financial crises that have occurred over the past 20 or 30 years.
