Ich bin 20 Jahre alt, International Business Student, und muss sagen ihr Content sowie Ihre Kommunikation ist mir mega sympathisch und bis jetzt das Beste was ich auch Youtube gefunden habe. Sie haben mehrmals betont, dass Sie an das Gesetzt der Anziehung glauben. Ich habe das Gesetz in einer nicht so sch\u00f6nen Phase meines Lebens vor einigen Jahren kennengelernt und lebe seither nach den Prinzipien. Mich w\u00fcrde sehr interessieren wie Sie dieses Gesetz kennengelernt haben bzw. wie Sie auf die Prinzipien gesto\u00dfen sind. Lebenserfahrung? Think and grow rich? Erziehung? W\u00fcrde mich sehr interessieren. Machen Sie weiter so und vielen Dank!", "authorDisplayName": "Daniel Scott", "publishedAt": "2021-05-18T06:47:25Z", "updatedAt": "2021-05-18T06:47:25Z"}, {"commentid": "UgzpbxkskcO7_kpaCxl4AaABAg", "videoId": "PDjbFIBAnqk", "textDisplay": "Herr Hopf, Analyst, Ern\u00e4hrungsberater, Psychologe u.v.a.m. Jedes Video ist seine Zeit Wert.

I for whatever reason cannot recall what it was\u2026. All I remember was you had 3 characters to choose from, one blue, one yellow, and one red, I think they were a hedgehog crab and duck? The gameplay was you moved your spinning character to clear orbs then eventually fight a boss. I remember one boss was an angler fish of some sort. The main villain was a mad scientist, and that\u2019s all I remember. I really want to track this game down but have no luck online searching for it. If anyone at all knows what I\u2019m talking about i would LOVE to know the title. It\u2019s definitely in the puzzle genre of games and it\u2019s a 3ds era title. I got it from GameStop when I was younger and remember replaying it so many times which is why it baffles me that I can\u2019t remember the title\ud83d\ude02 the red character I remember best, I\u2019m most positive that he was a crab. To be more specific the gameplay was that these little characters spun around to clear the orbs on a grid, the boss was it\u2019s own level.<br>Note: this was definitely one of the older 3ds era games, I wanna say it was probably 1-3 years into the 3ds lifespan but I could be wrong", "textOriginal": "GameStop has been the source of so many memories including my most played childhood game. I for whatever reason cannot recall what it was\u2026. All I remember was you had 3 characters to choose from, one blue, one yellow, and one red, I think they were a hedgehog crab and duck? The gameplay was you moved your spinning character to clear orbs then eventually fight a boss. I remember one boss was an angler fish of some sort. The main villain was a mad scientist, and that\u2019s all I remember. I really want to track this game down but have no luck online searching for it.
