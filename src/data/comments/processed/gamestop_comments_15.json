Ok lets back track for a bit. As a CEO of a company, he is NOT allowed to publicly state anything speculative. Why is this significant? Because he was asked about the synthetic shares being shorted. Since the share re count has not happened yet, he is not allowed to speculate on it. Now this brings us to the cryptic message when he &quot;accidentally&quot; showed us he is not wearing pants. This correlates with &quot;Naked shorts&quot; hence not wearing any pants. Coincidence? In my humble opinion, I dont think so. So to sum it up: Adam Aaron is sending us a cryptic message confirming that there are synthetic shares being shorted by showing that he is not wearing any pants during the interview aka &quot;Naked Shorts&quot;. In addition, he is very active with the ape community on twitter so he knows how to communicate with us indirectly. Given this cryptic message is correct, it is stupid to NOT HODL your shares, since the hedgies over-leveraged themselves and illegally shorted shares that do not exist!! So in simple APE terms, the longer we HODL, the more the hedgies bleed, the higher price they&#39;re going to have to pay to buy back those shares since they simply did not exist. PLEASE do not listen to the media as they are working together with the hedgies to cause fear and doubt. We need to be unified and keep HODLING. This is a WAR and we have a clear shot at winning this AS LONG AS WE HODL. <br><br>We saw multiple millionaires being made from AMC the past week, but this is just the beginning! I wanna see more people paying off their MEDICAL BILLS, I wanna see more people paying off their STUDENT DEBT, I wanna see more people buying their FIRST HOUSE, I wanna see more people creating GENERATIONAL WEALTH.

Ok lets back track for a bit. As a CEO of a company, he is NOT allowed to publicly state anything speculative. Why is this significant? Because he was asked about the synthetic shares being shorted. Since the share re count has not happened yet, he is not allowed to speculate on it. Now this brings us to the cryptic message when he \"accidentally\" showed us he is not wearing pants. This correlates with \"Naked shorts\" hence not wearing any pants. Coincidence? In my humble opinion, I dont think so. So to sum it up: Adam Aaron is sending us a cryptic message confirming that there are synthetic shares being shorted by showing that he is not wearing any pants during the interview aka \"Naked Shorts\". In addition, he is very active with the ape community on twitter so he knows how to communicate with us indirectly. Given this cryptic message is correct, it is stupid to NOT HODL your shares, since the hedgies over-leveraged themselves and illegally shorted shares that do not exist!! So in simple APE terms, the longer we HODL, the more the hedgies bleed, the higher price they're going to have to pay to buy back those shares since they simply did not exist. PLEASE do not listen to the media as they are working together with the hedgies to cause fear and doubt. We need to be unified and keep HODLING. This is a WAR and we have a clear shot at winning this AS LONG AS WE HODL. \n\nWe saw multiple millionaires being made from AMC the past week, but this is just the beginning! I wanna see more people paying off their MEDICAL BILLS, I wanna see more people paying off their STUDENT DEBT, I wanna see more people buying their FIRST HOUSE, I wanna see more people creating GENERATIONAL WEALTH. APE STRONG TOGETHER. I HODL FOR YOU, YOU HODL FOR ME \ud83d\udda4\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\n\nOh and for the hedgies reading this: \"I AINT FOOKN SELLIN \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d\"", "authorDisplayName": "Kyle K", "publishedAt": "2021-06-05T14:45:16Z", "updatedAt": "2021-06-05T14:45:16Z"}, {"commentid": "UgzmjZSG2xi4ZzGqjgd4AaABAg", "videoId": "Jt2ny9N3T6g", "textDisplay": "Strong together,  learn the nasty tricks wall street uses,  so you would be scare.

Der Typ ist mutig. Das muss man ihm lassen. Wir alle wissen aber auch, dass man extrem gro\u00dfe Verm\u00f6gen nur mit einer Konzentration des Kapitals hinbekommt. F\u00fcr mich selbst ist das nichts. Ich streue gerne mein Kapital sowohl in unterschiedliche Assets als auch innerhalb von Assets. Das ist f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich die bessere Variante. Ja, ich wei\u00df, dass ich damit nicht ultrareich werden kann. Aber, ich kann gut schlafen und muss nicht jede Nacht zittrig ins Bett gehen. Alles in Bitcoin? Nein, auf keinen Fall. Dennoch bin ich von Bitcoin extrem \u00fcberzeugt. Ich habe fast 1 Jahr gebraucht, um Bitcoin zu verstehen. Nie wieder w\u00fcrde ich auf Bitcoin als eine Assetklasse verzichten. Bin im April letzen Jahres eingestiegen und kaufe monatlich dazu. V\u00f6llig egal, was der Bitcoinpreis macht. Ich halte und verkaufe nie - vererbe ich sp\u00e4ter an die Kinder. Aber auch andere Assets sind gut z.B. Aktien, Kredite, Bargeld, Immobilien. Auch Edelmetalle und Rohstoffe sind keine schlechte Variante.
